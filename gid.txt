Generic Image Decoder
---------------------

The Generic Image Decoder is a package for decoding a broad variety
of image formats, from any data stream, to any kind of medium.

Some features:
- Standalone (no dependency on other libraires, bindings,...)
- Unconditionally portable code: OS-, CPU-, compiler- independent code.
- Multi-platform
- Task safe
- Endian-neutral
- Free, open-source

Through genericity and use of the Inline pragma at multiple
nesting levels (like macros inside macros), the package is
able to deliver a decent decoding performance with a reasonably
readable source code and without tediously copied pieces of code
with almost the same contents.

Note on the construction of GID.
--------------------------------

All image formats decoded by GID have similarities in their structure.

- Most begin with a header containing dimensions and color depth,
  and the image contents follow. This is obvious to have such a data
  organisation, since the header details are needed to calibrate the
  recipient of the image. 

- They are structured in blocks, with different names depending on
  the format:
  - PNG : chunks
  - GIF : blocks
  - JPEG: segments
  - TGA : areas
  - TIFF: tags
  etc.
