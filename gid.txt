- They all begin with a header containing dimensions and color depth,
  and the image contents follow. This is obvious to have such a data
  organisation, since the header details are needed to calibrate the
  recipient of the image

- They are structured in blocks, with different names depending on
  the format:
  - PNG : chunks
  - GIF : blocks
  - JPEG: segments
  - TGA : areas
  - TIFF: tags
  etc.
